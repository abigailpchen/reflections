1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains the files you may want to commit to a repo.

and the repo.  So, for example, if you have 3 files in the WD, and 2 work
together, you can add them to the staging area.  When you are ready to commit
them to the repo, you commit them.  The value of the SA is that it allows you

5.How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It helps to see how branches work, how they relate to master, and where they
diverged from master.
