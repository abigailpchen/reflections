1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initializes an empty repository.  You need to do it to tell git to operate
on that directory.

2.How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The working directory contains the files you may want to commit to a repo.
The staging area is the place where you put them between the working directory
and the repo.  So, for example, if you have 3 files in the WD, and 2 work
together, you can add them to the staging area.  When you are ready to commit
them to the repo, you commit them.  The value of the SA is that it allows you
to decide which files to move before you have committed them, and you can undo
the changes.
