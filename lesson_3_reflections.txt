1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

It could be useful when you are working with others, when using a different
device than usual, or when making a quick change to a file that could be faster
than accessing it locally.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

The changes might not have been ready to commit, it will help avoid merge
conflicts, and other people may be working on the same remote, so it could
cause confusion if pulls are made automatically and you are not ready for them.
